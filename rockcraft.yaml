# to ensure the flask-framework extension works properly, your Flask application
# should have an `app.py` file with an `app` object as the WSGI entrypoint.
# a `requirements.txt` file with at least the flask package should also exist.
# see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/1.13.0/reference/extensions/flask-framework
# for more information.

      # by default, only the files in app/, templates/, static/, migrate, migrate.sh,
      # migrate.py and app.py are copied into the image. You can modify the list
      # below to override the default list and include or exclude specific
      # files/directories in your project.
      # note: prefix each entry with "flask/app/" followed by the local path.

# you may need Ubuntu packages to build a python dependency. Add them here if necessary.
#   flask-framework/dependencies:
#     build-packages:
#       # for example, if you need pkg-config and libxmlsec1-dev to build one
#       # of your packages:
#       - pkg-config
#       - libxmlsec1-dev

# you can add package slices or Debian packages to the image.
# package slices are subsets of Debian packages, which result
# in smaller and more secure images.
# see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/1.13.0/explanation/chisel/

# add this part if you want to add packages slices to your image.
# you can find a list of packages slices at https://github.com/canonical/chisel-releases
#   runtime-slices:
#     plugin: nil
#     stage-packages:
#       # list the required package slices for your flask application below.
#       # for example, for the slice libs of libpq5:
#       - libpq5_libs

# if you want to add a Debian package to your image, add the next part
#   runtime-debs:
#     plugin: nil
#     stage-packages:
#       # list required Debian packages for your flask application below.
#       - libpq5
